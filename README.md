Hey guys, this repository will serve as our project repository.
WEEK 1
- Have a user be able to login and create an account as a volunteer and attributes such as age, gender, location, interests, and issue areas can be entered and saved 
- Have a link for users to start a chat in, they will be prompted for info such as age, gender or location and then options for responders sharing similar traits will pop up. Ideally there will be 3 options with the ability to refresh
- End result should be a limited front-end, a simple database (firebase), and an attempt at a matching algorithm/queue
